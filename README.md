# Azure Developer CLI (azd) Extensions Registry

This repository contains the official registry for Azure Developer CLI (azd) extensions. The registry serves as a central location where developers can discover and access community-contributed azd extensions.

## What are azd Extensions?

Azure Developer CLI extensions are tools that extend the functionality of azd, allowing developers to customize and enhance their development workflow with Azure. Extensions can provide additional commands, templates, and integrations to streamline cloud development processes.

## Contributing Your Extension

We welcome contributions from the community! If you've developed an azd extension that you'd like to share with other developers, you can submit it to this registry.

### How to Submit Your Extension

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Edit the `registry.json` file** to include your extension details
3. **Create a Pull Request** with your changes
